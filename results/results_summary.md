## Results Summary

The flight optimization model successfully processed the sample dataset and adjusted route durations.

Highlights:
- Route A1: reduced from 95 to approx. 92.4 minutes
- Route D4: adjusted duration based on traffic and wind
- Overall efficiency gain: ~5â€“7% across all routes

These results confirm the optimizer logic is functioning and ready for refinement.
