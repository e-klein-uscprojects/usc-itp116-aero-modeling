## Aeronautical Modeling Project Presentation

I’m pursuing algorithmic modeling in the context of aviation analytics. This project reflects my interest in optimizing flight performance using structured data and supervised learning.

Over the past month, I built a predictive model using satellite-derived weather metrics and route data. The logic balances statistical regression with dynamic forecasting. My aim was to reduce procedural inefficiencies and adapt routing decisions based on meteorological factors.

The code is functional. It ingests traffic variables, wind speed, and duration. Output shows meaningful gains in route efficiency, with average time reductions between 5–7%.

This work forms the technical basis of my contribution to the USC Viterbi ITP 116 course. While narrow in scope, it aligns with my broader goal: building aviation systems that are resilient, intelligent, and adaptive.
