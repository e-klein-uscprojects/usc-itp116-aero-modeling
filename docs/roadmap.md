## Project Roadmap

Next-phase development priorities:

- Integrate real-time weather APIs for dynamic route adjustment  
- Expand datasets to include airspace congestion and routing references  
- Refine optimizer logic with additional features (wind direction, fuel burn rate)  
- Build dashboard interface to visualize optimized outputs  
- Conduct performance benchmarking with real-world aviation data  
- Explore Streamlit deployment for interactive access
