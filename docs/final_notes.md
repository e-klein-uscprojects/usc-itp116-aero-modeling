## Final Notes

This project developed a functional optimization model for flight durations using structured aeronautical data.

Deliverables include:
- Python-based modeling logic (flight_optimizer.py)
- Sample dataset for validation
- Visual plot comparing original vs optimized values
- Strategic roadmap for future development

Tools and techniques were selected based on operational relevance and analytical precision.

The work reflects applied knowledge from USC ITP coursework and real-world aviation experience, focusing on efficiency, clarity, and adaptability.
